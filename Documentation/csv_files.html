        <h2>CSV files format</h2>

        <p>The plugin works with CSV files. Usually, any spreadsheet software can export its spreadsheets to this format.</p>

        <h3>Headers</h3>

        <p>The first line of the spreadsheet must be a header. Instead of containing data, its cells hold the name of the columns' data. The plugin requires the following header (and columns), in that order:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>id_observation: a number representing the row. The first row of data (right below the header) must have the number 1, the next one 2, and so on. A spreadsheet editor like Excel will help you easily fill this column.</li>
            <li>id a number identifying the radioemitter that was measured. It makes more sense to use different files for different radioemitters, so a file always contains the same value.</li>
            <li>nom the name of that radioemitter.</li>
            <li>date: time when the signal was measured. Example: 23/01/2018 03:48:00.</li>
            <li>lat: latitude (North) of the antenna when measuring.</li>
            <li>lon: longitude (East) of the antenna when measuring.</li>
            <li>azimut: angle in [0, 360[ indicating where the signal came from.</li>
            <li>filtre: filter level in [0, 10]. A greater value means that if the signal was measured, its emitter was closer.</li>
            <li>puissance strength of the signal in [0, 10]. A greater sum with niveau_filtre will produce a shorter line on the map layer, thus indicating a closer emitter.</li>
            <li>commentaire: any comment you want to associate with the data.</li>
        </ul>
